            <p>Karim discovered that the exams were kept in the professor's office. However, gaining access to the office proved to be a challenge. Outside the office, there stood a separate shelf, showcasing a series of books, each labeled with a number. These numbers held the key to opening the office.</p>
            <p>Karim closely examined the books on the shelf. Attached to each book was a number, indicating its significance in unlocking the office. It became apparent that there was a hidden word concealed within these numbers, serving as the password.</p> 
            <p>Karim noticed that the professor used only numbers with "*" and "#" symbols . This observation was the key to knowing the password.</p>
