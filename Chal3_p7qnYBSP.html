            <p>After arriving at the professor's house, Karim discovered that there was a password required to enter. Remembering his conversation with the professor's neighbor, Karim recalled that the password was changed every month.</p>
            <p>As he searched for clues to unlock the door, he checked under the doormat and found something unexpected  â€” an encrypted message tucked beneath it. It became evident that the message was intentionally placed there for his family to decipher and gain entry into the house.</p> 
            <p>With sense of purpose, Karim picked up the encrypted message which read : "I Xdxyjr."  Armed with the knowledge that the professor used a Caesar cipher, Karim began experimenting with different shift values to decrypt the message and unveil the password.</p>
            <p>After entering the house, Karim found himself in another room with another locked door blocking his way. On the walls, he noticed some art.</p>
